## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

## Binary Serarch

### Challenge Description

Search for a value in an array and return its index

### Approach & Efficiency

Using binary search, the process of finding a value within an array becomes much easier. If the value at the middle index of array is equal to the given value then return the index. If the value at the middle index is greater than or less than the value then call the function with the appropriate parameters.
